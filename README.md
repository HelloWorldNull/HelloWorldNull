Hello, World! I am HelloWorldNull. This is my school account which will be deleted in 2.5 years.
I like coding (duh), technology (again, duh), and video games.
There is not a very convenient way to reach me soo... I don't know.
Yeah, I am not good at typing README files, especially if it is about myself.
It is like I am writing my autobiography, which I don't really like.
That aside, come check out my projects! By 2026 they wont be able to be edited unless I
use my alt account and copy them, so yeah.
My alt account, by the way, is Input=Null or InputNull.
Not really sure how the usernames/handles work on GitHub.
Goodbye!
